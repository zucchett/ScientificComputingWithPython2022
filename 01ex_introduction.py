'''
1. The HelloWorld replacementl
a) Write a program that:
prints the numbers from 1 to 100
but for multiples of three print "Hello" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "World"
for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "HelloWorld".
b) Put the result in a tuple and substitute "Hello" with "Python" and "World" with "Works".

2. The swap
Write a program that swaps the values of two input variables x and y from command line (whatever the type).
Try to do that without using a temporary variable, exploiting the Python syntax.

3. Computing the distance
Write a function that calculates and returns the euclidean distance between two points u and v in a 2D space, where u and v are both 2-tuples (x,y).
Example: if u=(3,0) and v=(0,4), the function should return 5.
Hint: in order to compute the square root, import the math library with import math and use math.sqrt().
'''

6. Casting
Write a program that:

and print the result without making the code crash for all the int/float/str input combinations.
