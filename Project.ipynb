    "# Tracking muons with Drift Tubes chambers\n",
    "\n",
    "The project consist in the analysis of the data gathered by four drift-tubes detectors during a fixed-target beam test aimed at the production of muon pairs. This was achieved by directing 45 GeV positrons on a Beryllium target via the $e^+ + e^- \\to \\mu^+ + \\mu^-$ process. Most of the collisons result in the so-called \"background\" events (e.g. Bhabha scattering events, $e^+ + e^- \\to e^+ + e^-$), whereas only a small fraction produced a genuine muon pair (\"signal\" event). Right after the Berillium target, a dipole magnet deflects in different directions the trajectory of positively and the negatively charged particles. The muon drift-tube detectors are placed after the magnet, outside the magnetic field; two detectors each are placed along the direction of positive and negative particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "A signal event would consist of two straight tracks, each traversing two muon detectors.\n",
    "The following figure displays a signal event. It is possible to notice the positioning of the four drift-tubes detectors. Particles are moving essentially along the $z$ axis (the beam direction) after being bent along the $x$ axis by the dipole magnet occures. The $y$ coordinate is irrelevant in this context and it is not measured. \n",

    "Calibration runs are taken with a beam of positive muons at a given energy aimed on the target. These runs produce a single track on either of the two sides of the experiment, as shown in the following picture.

    "Each detector consists of four layers of drift-tubes, i.e. cells with an anodic wire at the center and cathods at the sides filled up with a gas mixture of ${\\rm Ar-CO_2}$ ($85\\%-15\\%$). The passage of a charged particle through a cell would ionize the gas, with a consequent drift of electrons towards the anodic wire. Exploiting a linear relation (the drift velocity inside the cell is constant), by measuring the time of arrival of the primary ionization, it is possible to reconstruct the track's position within the cell. Note that there is a left-right ambiguity in the determination of the position (blue-red dots in the display).\n",

Find an appropriate figure of merit to retain only the best fit and the corresponding left/right combination.
