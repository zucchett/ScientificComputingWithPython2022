    "Python is an **interpreted** high-level, general-purpose programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of **significant indentation**.\n",

    "Python is **dynamically-typed** (the type of a variable is checked at runtime) and **garbage-collected** (to avoid manual memory management).\n",
    "\n",
    "It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.\n",
