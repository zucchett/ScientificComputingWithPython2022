# You can solve these exercises in the room or at home. For this week, and the next 3 weeks, exercises have to be solved by creating a dedicated `.py` file (or files) called `02ex_fundamentals.py`.
# 
# In case you need multiple files, name them `02ex_fundamentals_es01.py`, `02ex_fundamentals_es02.py` and so on. In this case, it's convenient to create a dedicated directory, to be named `02ex_fundamentals`. 
# 
# The exercises need to run without errors with `python3`.

# 1\. **Global variables**
# 
# Convert the function $f$ into a function that doesn't use global variables and that does not modify the original list

# In[57]:


def f(alist):
    x = 5 #private in the function f
    a= alist[:]
    for i in range(x):
        a.append(i)
    return a
x=2 #global
alist = [1, 2, 3]
ans = f(alist)

print(ans)
print(alist) # alist has not been changed
print (x)    # will print the global value


# 2\. **List comprehension**
# 
# Write the following expression using a list comprehension:
# 
# `ans = list(map(lambda x: x * x, filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 1, range(10)))`

# In[5]:


ans = list(map(lambda x: x * x, filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 1, range(10))))
print (ans)
A = [x**2 for x in range (10) if x%2 ==1]
print (A)


# 3\. **Filter list**
# 
# Using the `filter()` hof, define a function that takes a list of words and an integer `n` as arguments, and returns a list of words that are shorter than `n`.

# In[12]:


def wordsFilter (A,n):
    B = list (map(lambda x:x, filter (lambda x: len(x)<n,A)))#we can make it <=
    return B
alist = ["iyadwehbe","iyadw", "word"]
n = 5
C= wordsFilter (alist,n)
print (C)


# 4\. **Map dictionary**
# 
# 
# Consider the following dictionary:
# 
# `lang = {"Python" : 3, "Java" : '', "Cplusplus" : 'test', "Php" : 0.7}`
# 
# Write a function that takes the above dictionary and uses the `map()` higher order function to return a list that contains the length of the keys of the dictionary.

# In[9]:


lang = {"Python" : 3, "Java" : '', "Cplusplus" : 'test', "Php" : 0.7}
def theFun(lang):
    a=[i for i in lang]
    b=[]
    for i in a:
        b.append(len(i))
    return b
print (theFun(lang))


# 5\. **Lambda functions**
# 
# Write a Python program that sorts the following list of tuples using a lambda function, according to the alphabetical order of the first element of the tuple:
# 
# `language_scores = [('Python', 97), ('Cplusplus', 81), ('Php', 45), ('Java', 32)]`
# 
# *Hint*: use the method `sort()` and its argument `key` of the `list` data structure.

# In[ ]:





# 6\. **Nested functions**
# 
# Write two functions: one that returns the square of a number, and one that returns its cube.
# 
# Then, write a third function that returns the number raised to the 6th power, using only the two previous functions.

# 7\. **Decorators**
# 
# Write a decorator named `hello` that makes every wrapped function print “Hello World!” each time the function is called.
# 
# The wrapped function should look like:
# 
# ```python
# @hello
# def square(x):
#     return x*x
# ```

# 8\. **The Fibonacci sequence (part 2)**
# 
# Calculate the first 20 numbers of the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) using a recursive function.

# 9\. **The Fibonacci sequence (part 3)**
# 
# Run both the Fibonacci recursive function from the previous exercise, and the Fibonacci function from 01ex that use only `for` and `while` loops.
# 
# Measure the execution code of the two functions with `timeit` ([link to the doc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html)), for example:
# 
# `%timeit loopFibonacci(20)`
# 
# `%timeit recursiveFibonacci(20)`
# 
# which one is the most efficient implementation? By how much?

# 10\. **Class definition**
# 
# Define a class `polygon`. The constructor has to take a tuple as input that contains the length of each side. The (unordered) input list does not have to have a fixed length, but should contain at least 3 items.
# 
# - Create appropriate methods to get and set the length of each side
# 
# - Create a method `perimeter()` that returns the perimeter of the polygon
# 
# - Create a method `getOrderedSides(increasing = True)` that returns a tuple containing the length of the sides arranged in increasing or decreasing order, depending on the argument of the method
# 
# Test the class by creating an instance and calling the `perimeter()` and `getOrderedSides(increasing = True)` methods.

# 11\. **Class inheritance**
# 
# Define a class `rectangle` that inherits from `polygon`. Modify the constructor, if necessary, to make sure that the input data is consistent with the geometrical properties of a rectangle.
# 
# - Create a method `area()` that returns the area of the rectangle.
# 
# Test the `rectangle` class by creating an instance and passing an appropriate input to the constructor.
