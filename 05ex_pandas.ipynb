Each measurement (i.e. each row of the input file) consists of a flag that specifies the type of message ('HEAD', which in this case is always 1), two addresses of the TDC providing the signal ('FPGA' and 'TDC_CHANNEL'), and the timing information ('ORBIT_CNT', 'BX_COUNTER', and 'TDC_MEAS'). Each TDC count corresponds to 25/30 ns, whereas a unit of BX_COUNTER corresponds to 25 ns, and the ORBIT_CNT is increased every `x` BX_COUNTER. This allows to store the time in a similar way to hours, minutes and seconds."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"pycharm":{"is_executing":true},"id":"pNjYVzmq2RwF"},"outputs":[],"source":["# If haven't downloaded it yet, please get the data file with wget\n","#!wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/xvjzaxzz3ysphme/data_000637.txt -P ./data/"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wRS0n-v12RwH"},"source":["1\\.
